<p align="center">Highly customizable resume builder using Parcel.js<p>

## Usage
Make sure you have parcel installed. If not `yarn global add parcel-bundler` or `npm install -g parcel-bundler`

First `yarn` to install dependencies and then `yarn start` to run the development server at `localhost:1234`

When satisfied with your edits use the browser's print dialogue to Save as PDF.

> ☝ If you're using Chrome on Windows, select Save as PDF and not Microsoft Print to PDF for better results

> ☝ If you find that the colors are a darker than you expect make sure `Background graphics` is checked
